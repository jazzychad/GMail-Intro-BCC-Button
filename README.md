# GMail Intro BCC Button

This is an [InboxSDK](https://www.inboxsdk.com/) app for GMail which
adds an Intro BCC button to the reply composer. This is useful for
when you receive an introduction and want to reply to the 3rd party
directly and move the mutual 2nd party to BCC (this is a common
behavior when replying to an intro).

This app comes in the form of a Chrome Extension which you can enable
by opening `chrome://extensions` and making sure `Developer Mode` is
checked. Then you can `Load unpacked extension...` from the cloned
repo directory.
